            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O BE IT (GOOD Chriſtian Reader) that thou hauing prouided for thy ſelfe, aboundaunce of wealth in this worlde, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſubſtaunce, plentifull commodities, with hope to augment and increaſe the ſame by large and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gaynes: and haſt ſetled thy heart, to builde thee a ſumptuous, ſtrong, and beautifull houſe; as well for the beſtowing and ordering of theſe thy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ryches, as for the ſure and ſafe cuſtodie of them, ſaying with thy ſelfe: this yeare I will be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in ſearching out of Timber, Stone, Bricke, Lyme, Labourers and excellent workemen, for the better accompliſhing of this my deuice. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde yeare I will be furniſhed of all theſe thinges, and prepare them readie for the worke: and the thirde yeare I minde to builde and erect my houſe. Will not thy heart burne within thee, while the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation hereof is thus fixed within thy breaſt? wilt thou not imagine, that while all theſe thinges are in performing according to thy deſire, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day will be a yeare, and euery yeare a number? Wouldeſt thou not with an earneſt deſire ſeeke to bee releaſed of this hope ioyned with feare, planted within thy breaſt, and with all the trauell of thy bodie, labour to ſee the ende of this thy deuice and
<pb facs="tcp:1748:6"/>purpoſe, and that with all expedition? Whileſt thou art yet caſting and pondering of all theſe matters in thy minde, howe to bring them to good effect: If two of thy deereſt friendes, who haue a ſpeciall regarde to thy bodie leaſt it ſhould periſh with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and care, doe preſently come vnto thee: The one of them ſaying: Beholde, the Timber, Bricke, Stone, Lyme, and all other neceſſarie thinges, for buylding, which I layde vp in ſtore for mine owne ſelfe, my wife, and my children, to buylde vs an houſe withall, I haue ment towardes thee. And that other friend alſo, the ſooner to deliuer thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy troubleſome imaginations, ſay vnto thee: Loe, all theſe things meete for buylding, I haue brought to the place where thou haſt determined to lay thy foundation. The plat forme is drawne: the ſtuffe is excellent, and well wrought: the worke is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and readie to be erected: and the ſeaſon of the yeare verie well ſerueth. Therefore eaſe thy minde, vnburthen thy conſcience, ſet thy heart at libertie: Now there remayneth no trauell for thee, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, that thou throughlye ouerſee and ſuruay the whole gift, which we haue beſtowed vpon thee. That is to ſaye: beginning with the firſt ſtone of the foundation, vewing and beholding euery thing by percell meale, till thou come to the principall Piller in the middeſt, vpon which, the whole work is appoynted to depende: And ſo continuing thy vewe and ſuruay, till thou come to the laſt part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the roofe of the ſame houſe, there to beholde
<pb facs="tcp:1748:6"/>the force and ſtrength therof, for reſiſting the ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie tempeſtes of raging Winter. When thou haſt thus done, beginne thy houſe, and finiſhe the ſame in fewe dayes, to thy contentation, which before thou diddeſt feare, in many yeares coulde ſcarcely haue beene perfourmed. Wilt thou nowe thou worldly mynded man, bee vngratefull for this ſo high an earthly benifite receyued? Or wilt thou not conſent, to this ſo reaſonable and friendly a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, of ſuch thy deare friendes? Nay, (I am ſure) thou wilt not onely bee thankefull, but alſo wilt runne with all diligence, with great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with louing countenaunce, and with all feaſt and melodie, to imbrace them, who haue deliuered thy bodie from trauell and watching, and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thy minde from the thing whereof it ſtoode in feare. Yea, and I doubt not, but thou wilt with a glad and willing mynde, accompliſhe and fulfill this their gentle and eaſie requeſt made vnto thee. If now, thou haue thus taken carke and care, about the buylding of an earthly mancion, to repoſe and lay vp thy temporall treaſure, to place and ſolace thy carrian Carkaſſe.: If thou haue thus taken thought for the bodie, ſo corruptible a thing, ſo looſe of life, ſo ſhort of lyfe, ſo vncertaine of lyfe, and of it ſelfe alone no life, which ſo many yeares is a growing, and ſo fewe houres a fading: if thou be thus diſcharged of thy bodily trauell, and of the feare of trauell, by theſe thy two ſpeciall friendes: Howe much more circumſpection, and
<pb facs="tcp:1748:7"/>ſtedfaſt care and diligence, oughteſt thou to haue ouer thy ſoule, ſo incorruptible a thing, ſo eternall, ſo heauenly, and vnſpeakeable a gift, in ſo ſhort a minute chaunged, from ſinne to bleſſe, from man to an Aungell, from earth to Paradice, from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie lyfe, to vnſpeakable thouſandes of ages, from warre to rewarde, from tryall of fayth, to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph for victorie, from continuall vexation, ſtrife and vnquietneſſe, to perpetuall conſolation, ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and quietneſſe: Howe much more prouident (eſpeciallye in this wonderfull age wherein thy mynde is ſo mooued and toſſed to and fro, to ſee the worlde wonder, and the Deuill rage, that Chriſt his true Religion is rayſed vppe and publiſhed) oughteſt thou to bee in puruaying for the aſſured knowledge of the true Tranquillitie, ſtay, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of thy minde: a matter ſufficient and able to buylde thee a celeſtiall habitation, wherein thou mayeſt lay vp thy heauenly treaſure: wherein thou ſhalt inioy the parpetuall fellowſhip of Aungelles, the continuall contemplation of Gods deuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, the fruition of euerlaſting ioy and felicitie, and the liuely fountaine of eternall lyfe. If thou with this lightneſſe of hearte, with this zeale of minde, and with theſe tokens of gladneſſe, wilt accept and imbrace thy friends, which haue ſhewed thee of ſo earthly a commoditie, of ſo fraile a thing, and (as I maye terme it) of ſuch a maſſe of Morter: With how much more feruent zeale, pure loue, and beneuolent minde, (beloued) art thou to accept the
<pb facs="tcp:1748:7"/>Author hereof, and Tranſlator of the ſame, who haue preſented ſo ſinguler a benifite vnto thee as is this booke, which may ſo much further and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite thee for the ſafetie of thy ſoule. The one of theſe thy friendes, nurſt and educated, in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull lappe of liberall ſcience: the other led (till he had ſeene this booke) with delightes, and trayned (from youth) to the intiſementes of Courtly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The one, alwayes fedde, with deuine foode of Euangelicall Doctrine: the other taught (till ere-whilſte) with prophane knowledge of obſcure darkeneſſe. The one practiſing as well by his life, as by his penne, to compile and gather togither, the deepe and ſecret wiſedome of Tranquillitie of the minde: the other (beeing ſcoller to this booke, and hauing put in proufe, the Leſſons therein learned) remayneth as a witneſſe to the worlde, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde conſolation and commoditie reaped by the ſame. The one hauing layde vp in ſtore, this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous ſtuffe of building, for the edifying of hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and of all thoſe in the vniuerſall worlde which vnderſtand the Latine tongue: the other for the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he oweth to hys Countrie, hath brought foorth the ſame, and layde it readie before the eyes of all oure Engliſhe Nation and Countrie. All the thanks and recompence, which he hopeth to reape of thee, is that thou (and that for thine owne ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler pleaſure, comfort, and commoditie) wylt wholye reade ouer the ſame, eſpecially bycauſe it is one whole continued ſtile and Oration, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:1748:8"/>conſequently, (yet playnly, eaſily, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtlye) one poynt vpon an other: And therefore, thou muſt of neceſsitie ſo doe, if thou wilt learne how to obtaine the true quietneſſe of thy mynde. This I will aſſure thee (gentle Reader,) that if thou wylt, with attentiue eares pervſe this booke, in ſuch ſort, as I haue declared vnto thee: of what ſtate, condicion, or degree ſo euer thou bee, or howe ſo euer thy bodie bee inclined, or thy mynde affected, thou ſhalt reape ineſtimable and heauenly profite thereby. In ſuch ſort as if thou be high of dignitie: thou wilt not become diſdainefull: If thou bee baſe of ſtate: ambicious. Or if thou bee meane of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: mutable and inconſtant. Neyther in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, thou wilt ſhewe thy ſelfe vngratefull, but thankefull: not prowde, but lowly of ſpirite. In ſodaine ſadneſſe: thou wilt lay holde vpon ſpeedie meryneſſe. In vnreaſonable merineſſe: vpon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete temperaunce. In the leaden lethargie and diſeaſe of ſinne: vpon the quicke remembraunce of mercie by Chriſt. In aduerſitie, thou wilt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impacient, nor penſiue: but quiet and ioyfull. In ſickneſſe, not murmuraunt and waywarde: but pacient and content with Gods viſitation. Yea, ſuch fruite mayſt thou finde, by ſome ſmall paynes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed herein, as I dare ſpeake it, thou ſhalt confeſſe thy ſelfe, to ſtand a thouſand tymes more afeard of thy three moſt ſpitefull aduerſaries (I meane the worlde the fleſhe and the deuill) when the worlde moſt flattreth thee, with the glorious and glittering

Afeard (I ſay) in ſuch ſafe proſperitie, leaſt God make ſmall account of thee: glad and ioyfull in pinching aduerſity, bicauſe he acknowledgeth thee for his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall child, and not reiecteth thee as a reprobate ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard. That thou being thus mortified to the world, and renued by Chriſt, to the life to come, mayeſt (ſo long as the bleſſed will of God is, that thy wretched carkaſſe ſhal yet remaine vpon the face of the earth) be ſo light and glad of heart, ſo firme, calme, &amp; quiet of minde, in the true faith of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed with angelicall, and ſpiritual cogitation vpon deuine and heauenly treaſures: as thy verie ſelf, may be alredy ſeperated from thy ſelfe, and thy body no longer ſeme to beare, rule, ſuppreſſe, and Priſon the ſpirit (as in euery carnall minded man it doth.) But the ſpirite altogither to direct, ſanctifie, ſubdue and gouerne the bodie, and the ſame to beare, leade, and carie about with it, no leſſe, than if it were alreadie chaunged, and lifted vp to the euerlaſting felicitie of Gods eternall kingdome, purchaſed for vs by hys ſonne Ieſus, who with the father &amp; the holy ghoſt, one eternall God be bleſſed, prayſed, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, nowe and in the worlde to come.

Many other cuſtomes (eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to lyfe) I coulde recite, both to ſhewe the deſire of al men in getting, and the ſtrife of many in ſéeking a reſt from their cares: and whereby I might diſcouer the errour almoſt of all men, in declining from the true tranquillitie of the minde, which they ſtriue to attaine: But with theſe foure kinde of trades, which hitherto I haue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, I will ſatiſfie my ſelfe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1748:17"/>in me, thoſe things, which both may be acceptable and pleaſaunt vnto him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo profitable and commodious to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</p>
            <p>And firſt let vs go backe againe to thoſe foure chiefe kindes of lyfe, which the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous ſort, the ſtudious of gaine, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytique, and Philoſophers, do labour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. And let vs with ſome greater conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſearche out, whither in lucre and aduauntage, in worſhip and renoume, in knowledge or cunning, the true tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the minde may be found: ſince in theſe (as within their chiefeſt limites and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt boundes) thoſe former things conſiſt and haue their being.</p>
            <p>The vnlawfull luſt of voluptuouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men haue no part with tranquility of minde.</note> which with the pleaſauntneſſe thereof, ſo eaſily créepeth into the minde, will neuer finde any ende, neyther yet can the thirſt of vnlawful deſire, be euer ſatiſfied. They ſay, that <hi>Xerxes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Xerxes.</note> when as all things had proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly happened vnto him according to his minde before his paſſage into Gréece, promiſed a rewarde vnto him, that coulde finde out a newe pleaſure. But the thirſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1748:17"/>of his deſire was ſuch, as no pleaſure, were it euer ſo wittily deuiſed, coulde ſatiſfie his minde.</p>
            <p>Morcouer, the pleaſure of the bodie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding and paſſing quickly awaye, doth oftner (as the Philoſophers ſay) leaue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of repentance behinde it, than of calling the ſame to remembraunce being paſt. But ſuch repentaunce, oftentymes approching, (bicauſe it ingendreth griefe, and cauſeth a certaine inwarde gnawing through ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe) vtterly excludeth all quietneſſe of mynde. A great way of, are the tender and delicate perſons, which loue fineneſſe. Yea, and farre of, are they, which be filled with daintie fare, till they ſweate &amp; blow againe, and much lyke vnto fatte oxen, giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſurfetting and drongenneſſe, farre diſſonant, from the ſwéete and ſound ioy of the temperate ſort, which followe noble ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence and moderation in fare and dyet. For the firſt entering to voluptuouſneſſe, although it ſéeme pleaſant, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it bringeth bitter endings with it: and vnleſſe repentaunce be had, incurres at length hell fyre. They which are occupied
<pb facs="tcp:1748:18"/>with the Tabret and Harpe, and reioyce at the ſounde of the Pype, ſpende their dayes as beſt lyketh them: but in a moment (ſaith the pacient <hi>Iob</hi>) they go downe to hell.<note place="margin">Iob. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuable is the reioyceing of this worlde, wherevnto the voluptuous ſort doe truſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer much, and wherein (according to the frantike maner) forgetting their weaknes, raſhely and wildely, they fall to leaping for ioy: ſuch deſerue the curſe of God.

               </note> and being corrupt and marred, with the inticementes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this worlde, made no reckoning of the immortall lyfe to come: therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting hence, was caſt hedlong into hell, to be tormented with horrible torments of Deuils, and to be adiudged to the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all flames and fires, there continually to be burned.

What thing more horrible and wicked is there, than to prouoke the fleſh to vncomelineſſe and diſhoneſtie, which alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of it ſelfe rageth more than is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For ſince the Philoſophers agrée, that as the horſe is made to runne, the oxe to drawe, the dogge to ſéeke out: ſo man is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned to two things (that is to ſay) to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, and doe: and doth not pleaſure, the enimie to reaſon, make féeble, corrupt and ſubuert the whole worke of man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he was ordeyned, and alſo chaunge him, from the nature of a moſte excellent creature, into an inclination which is more than femenine? For pleaſure, if it be anye thing great, is a hinderaunce to councell, weakneth the memorie, abateth the ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of witte, taketh away the power of conſtantineſſe, and the ſtrength of agillitie, dulleth not onely the eyes of the minde, but vtterlye alſo extinguiſheth the light of the ſoule: and in proceſſe of tyme, ſo tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a man, into a moſt fooliſhe and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton

            <p>It doth me good to recite the Poets, who hauing no knowledge of Chriſt, yet they ſubmitted all thinges vnto God, whome of <hi>Iuuando</hi> (that is helping) they named <hi>Ioue,</hi> of bountifulneſſe, they called him the beſt: and vnto whome they attributed the care and charge of all mans cauſes. Yea, and make mention alſo, that he would at length take accounte of his ſeruauntes, euen of ſuch, as be kinges and gouernours of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales. But to come nigher the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: who is he, that hath not heard (if hée haue read but a fewe of the auncient wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) howe many Emperours haue béene depoſed, and pulled from their ſeates, and alſo, how the royall power of kinges, hath

The Hiſtories, are full of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in Monarchies, of the ſeruitude of kingdomes frée borne, and of the deſtruction of noble Cities. Therefore, whether care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full coueting, hath not obtaynde this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſed degrée of honor: or if it haue obteined the ſame, the carefull feare of chaunge: or if it haue loſt it, the ſorowfull calling to mind of that which was forgotten: will be a let to an ambicious perſon, that he can not be quiet and voyde of care.

               </note> Vnto whome, the very heauens haue ſo declared the glorie of God, and the firmament ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his handie workes, as by reaſon onelye of the order, beautie, and workmanſhip of things created, they acknowleged the very creator of the world, and his eternal power: and thereby learned, with what meanes
<pb facs="tcp:1748:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>they might picke out, and laye holde vpon his wiſedome and diuine nature. Theſe men haue gone more néerer than the reſt, to a quietneſſe from their troubles. For in <hi>Socrates</hi> there remayned alwayes one maner of countenaunce, and one grauitie. Of verie right (ſaith <hi>Cycero</hi>) muſt hée be calme and quiet, alwayes of one chéere, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no variabilitie in his minde, whereof the other is framed, and whereto it is ſemblant. And what doth Philoſophie promiſe to bring to paſſe, being adorned with ſo many high prayſes, as it is called the guide of our life, the ſchoolemaiſter of manners, the mother of vertues, the expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of vices, the tilling of the witte, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of the minde? doth it not promiſe a reſt from cares, &amp; delectation of the mindes of ſuch as be trauellers therein? And doth ſhe not (as in hir owne right) challenge the ſhaking of, of vaine carefulneſſe, quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of luſts, driuing away of feare, and the curing (or to ſpeake leaſt) the moderating of turmoyles of the minde. Neyther doth Phyloſophie, ſet forth onely in vtter ſhewe ſo greate a profeſſion, but the héerers alſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1748:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>thereof, being taught goodly preceptes, and inſtructed with iolly perſwaſions, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare both by their life &amp; communication, the vertue and force therof reſting in them. Which of the olde Phyloſophers, was ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moued with the occaſions of ſorrowe, or was appalled at death when it aproched. <hi>Socrates</hi> faſt bounde in priſon, ſeaſed not to diſpute of Phyloſophie: and the very daye of his death, reaſoned at large, concerning the immortalitie of the ſoule. And when in his hande he helde that deadly cuppe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this miſerable body with ſo pleaſant and iocande a minde, as he ſéemed not to be preaſed to his death, but vſing pleaſaunt wordes, as if he had gone to a ſolemne ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of his friendes, whome he had not ſéene a good whyle before. Wherefore, to ſuch as know not Chriſt, beyng not yet reuealed to all the worlde, I woulde iudge no kinde of life comperable to the Phyloſophers: eyther if they ſéeke to driue away cares, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elſe, for the naturall recreation of their mindes. For what is there, that eyther in welth and riches, eyther in pleaſure and paſtime, either in honor and aduancement,
<pb facs="tcp:1748:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>doth ſo excéedingly pacifie the minde, and poures gladneſſe therin, as doth the ſcience of Phyloſophie, and knowledge thereof, which hath beene author of thoſe goulden precepts of lyuing, and being collected into bookes, hath publiſhed the ſame for a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall to all the poſterities.</p>
            <p>But after that Chriſt,<note place="margin">True tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie is ſcuered from Philoſophie and is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerred to Chriſt.</note> the brightneſſe of glorie, (who being the ſame light that giueth light to euerie man comming into this worlde) ſhewed himſelfe to the earth, and opened the ſecret will of his father, and the true knowledge of tranquillitie of the minde, both to kingdomes and nations: we are commaunded to here his voyce, him to obey and ſerue, him to follow as our onely ſhepherde and maiſter, in whome all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſedome and knowledge lye hid. The Phyloſophers were but men, and (as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> calleth them) but naturall men, who coulde attaine no higher from earthly things, than the naturall reaſon of man woulde permitte them. But Chriſt, both is, and was the ſonne of God: who of his infinite mercy, left the throne of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie in heauen, and from the boſome of his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1748:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>father, deſcended downe vpon the earth, to open the miſteries hid from euery genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince the beginning of the worlde, that wherevnto man being but a creature could not attaine by reaſon of his blindeneſſe, therevnto his minde might aſcende, being lightned, chaunged, and regenerated by the ſpirite of Chriſt. And the Phyloſophers doe chiefly exhorte euerye one to that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye and triumphant victorie (which is ment of our luſtes and appetites) than which, they accompt none more greater, nor yet more honorable. For he that hath ouercome an enimie, was of more force than his enimie, but he that by reſtrayning himſelfe, bridleth his owne luſtes, ſuch a one hath ouercome himſelfe. He that hath ouerthrowne his enimie, hath van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed an externe aduerſarie:<note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> but he that ſubdueth his owne deſires, conquereth a Rebell and domeſticall Traytour. There is no euill, that is not eaſier to be reſiſted, than worldly pleaſure. For of what ſorte ſo euer it be, the ſame is a terror to vs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at the firſt ſight, and for the aſperitie thereof, ſtriketh vs with a quaking feare.
<pb facs="tcp:1748:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>For ſhe with hir ſmiling lookes, allureth men vnto hir, and with hir ſweete motions falling into the ſenſes, ſpéedily winneth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, no leſſe than doth the ſong of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde call backe and drawe to hir compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuch as paſſe by. Through wanton plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures was <hi>Hanniball</hi> vndone at <hi>Capua:</hi> yet could no ouerthrow in battel diſcomfite him.

With ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, the Phyloſophers doe annimate and incorage vs to this difficult &amp; hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and teach &amp; inſtruct vs with all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes they can: and yet doe they neyther kéepe néere the right courſe, nor rightly ſet forth the ſame: and are neyther preſent with their hearers as they ſhoulde be, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indue them with diuine powre from

            <p>But Chriſt leadeth vs from all wandring and troubleſome croſſewayes of error and blindneſſe, and ſetteth vs with his doctrine,<note place="margin">Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quillity trantierred to Chriſt.</note> a true and readie way: and doth not only ſit as Iudge of our doings, but furniſheth vs alſo with the whole armour of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, we being armed and fortified on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſide, maye reſiſt all our aduerſaries at once: both ouercome the motions of the fleſhe, and kéepe our ſoules vndefiled from the worlde. And the ſame Chriſt, being truly preſent with his ſpirit in euery place, both exhorteth vs to fight, indueth vs from aboue with ſtrength to the battell, by hys grace helpeth vs to ouercome, when wée faint lifteth vs vp, and when we get the victorie crowneth vs. Moreouer, although we willingly imbrace the wholſome admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of Philoſophers, whereby we are called to remember our frailtie and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to kéepe downe the pride of man: and although we ſet ſome ſtore by thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſputations, which deliuered the minde from periſhing, and ſo earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored

Euen ſo much, as ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eie hath ſéene, neyther eare hath heard, neyther heart hath imagined. Yet ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of féeling thereof, hath God reueled to his elect by his holy ſpirite. But of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding greatneſſe of that vnſpeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, none of the olde Philoſophers coulde ſo much as dreame vpon, or make coniecture of. Which thing, God, in his ſonne Ieſus hath appoynted as a right of inheritaunce, to be inioyed of the true worſhipers of him: euen ſince the firſt beginning of the world, and creation of all things. For others lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the holy ſpirit of promiſe and adoption, which God imparteth to the faythfull, that deſire and call vpon him for the ſame: and by the inſpiration of the ſame ſpirite, doth regenerate, quicken, and renue, teach, rule, gouerne, ſanctifie, erect, comfort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vs in fayth, helpeth our infirmitie, maketh vs light and readie to all good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Through which we crie with boldneſſe <hi>Abba</hi> father: which doth beare witneſſe

Wherefore ſeeing in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the way to Chriſt is ſo large, as he is preſent euerie where with his elect to their lyues ende, and to the laſt conſummation of the worlde: we haue no néede eyther to include our ſelues in Monaſteries or houſes of Religion vnder a name of holineſſe, or to take long pilgrimages in hand for the quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our minde: or to hide and kéepe our ſelues in ſecret wilderneſſe, as the maner was of religious ſort in olde time: vnleſſe like perſecution of Chriſtians ſhould waxe hote againe, as in thoſe dayes it did. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man abiding in that vocation whiche God hath called him vnto, ſhall reache to the true ioye of the minde, and attaine to the true ſolitarie contempt of the worlde,

Hereof groweth ſo often chaunging of our trade of lyfe, which ſéemes to bring a happie ſtate with it, when in déed, they differ not much from ſickmen, which ſo often doe alter their purpoſe.

By the ſinne of our firſt parents it was purchaſed, that nothing can cauſe a continuall merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in man, but that after myrth ſadneſſe muſt come: after maryage widdowhoode: after fruitfulneſſe, abortion and barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: care and vexation annexed to the bringing vp of children: to the honourable life, diſhonour: to proſperitie, miſfortune: after delicate fare a cloyde ſtomacke: and after health, ſickneſſe to enſue. But to leaue this varietie of thinges, and to ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of warre and ciuill diſcention, which in ſuche violent ſort breakes out into the life of man, and diſquietes the reſt thereof, deſtroying many thouſandes of men, not

And no maruell: for the fleſh being a Rebell, and as it were a home borne eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, fiercely prouoketh and ſtirreth vs to miſchiefe, neuer ceaſeth to aſſaile vs hande to hande, ſuffereth the conflicte to haue no reſt, not the leaſt moment of tyme.</p>
            <p>The worlde, and Sathan Prince and Lord thereof, being capitall, and continuall eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mankinde, conſpire our deſtruction in ſuch vnderminding ſorte, as if they were néere friendes vnto vs.<note place="margin">Our life a continuall warfare.</note> In battell ſtande we all our whole life, ſo long as we lyue here. For mans life it ſelfe vpon earth, is nothing but continuall warfare, &amp; wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and a certaine gréeuous conflict with thrée moſt cruell and noyſome aduerſaries. In which fight, few haue the victorie, but
<pb facs="tcp:1748:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>many be ouerthrowne, &amp; being ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged departe from God. Hereof commeth it that ſickneſſe ſo gréeueth one man, and puts him from ſléepe: and an other is ſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with feare of the euill that hangeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his heade. This is it that maketh one were haſtye with anger and grudge: and an other, eyther with loue to be penſiue, or with luſt to be kindled. Here through, one falles into ouer vehement laughter, wyth inordinate ioye, and an other into immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate lamentation, and vnreaſonable ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. One prouoked with gréefe to ſée an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in proſperitie, and another compelde through ambition of the wicked, to ſéeke, and currie fauell. And to conclude: hereof it commeth that one, receyuing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, is gréeued, and ſtudieth to reuenge: An other being author of a wronge, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at other mens harmes, and ſéekes to kéepe him ſtill vnder whome he hath once oppreſt. So is the minde it ſelfe, at warre with it ſelfe, and through contrarie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant affections,<note place="margin">The craftie wylineſſe of Sathan.</note> is rent, and in a maner torne in péeces. Incredible (truly) is the craft of Sathan in interrupting the true
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1748:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>quietneſſe of our minde, and in making his aſſaultes vpon vs. Of whome we are not ſo much to ſtande in feare, when he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſheweth himſelfe vnto vs what he is, as when he layes his baytes for vs, and (as the Apoſtle ſaith) tranſformes himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Aungell of light. Oftentimes hée doth openly aſſayle vs, when he prouoketh vs to thoſe outwarde haynous ſinnes: as to ſurfetting, dronkeneſſe, whoredome, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie, inceſt, murder, poyſoning, and ſuch lyke. But more oftener doth he ſet vppon vs vnwares and vnprouided, by his wiles cloſely vnderminding vs, and making e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one in his vocation, ſlothfull, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and ſlow in hearing the worde of god, in true holineſſe, in honeſt déedes, in déedes of charitie, in prayer, &amp; giuing god thanks. And whylſt they be thus careleſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſpect, he layeth holde of them vppon the ſodaine. Sometime, he flatteringly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeth vs to ſinne, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende he may deceiue vs: pleaſeth vs, to hurt vs, allureth vs, to ſlea vs: qualifieth the greatneſſe of ſinne: pute out of our minde, the gréeuous thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God: takes away the féele of gods
<pb facs="tcp:1748:35"/>wrath againſt ſinne, to the intent he may make a ſinner careleſſe on euery ſide. An other while, cleane contrarie, he aggreua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the greatneſſe of ſinne, ſhewing what we are to feare and dread: willeth vs to take experiment, by the horrible puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and examples of others. And ſo, we being ſodeynly confounded, by percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Gods wrath, driues vs well néere to deſperation, and after a ſort, takes from vs, all hope of forgiueneſſe. This craftes maiſter, and worker of all euilles, as he is a craftie, wily, and an olde practiſed fiende, ſo doth he deſtroye all perſons with theyr owne weapon. There is no kinde of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, no craft, no ſubtile meane, no deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deuiſe, and no laying in wayte, that ſo auncient an aduerſarie, and ſo olde an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, hath not perfitely learned and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, through vſe it ſelfe, by the antiquitie, of ſo many thouſand yeares ſpace. Whom he cannot allure, with the pleaſauntneſſe and delectation of vice, him doth he intrap, with admiration, and pride of vertue. And whoſe minde, he perceyues flieth from other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, his heart doth he puffe vp with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1748:35"/>pride of his well doing. Wherefore, he is no leſſe to be feared when he is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he himſelfe doth ouercome, ſince he executeth his buſineſſe, as well the one way as the other. Firſt of al (ſaith ſaint <hi>Cyprian</hi>) he goeth about couertly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue: For he promiſeth earthly honors, to depriue vs of the heauenly. He ſheweth vs of falſe matters, that he may priuily conuey away the true. But if he cannot couertly beguile vs, then he openlye bendes hys threates and terrors, agaynſt all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of God. Deceytfull is he in tyme of peace, and cruell in time of perſecution. We muſt therefore be héedefull, and labor with al our might, and with a ſinguler care and diligence, to reſiſt our cruell enimie, and ſuche his fierie dartes, as are bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt vs, wherewith we maye be ſtriken and wounded.

One wreſtleth with the diſeaſe of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, and preuayling but little (ſtriuing with the deafe) doth waſte his laboure, to complaine of the ſtraite lawe of ſingle life, and of mariage forbidden him. (Out of which fountaine, vndiſcretely the Prelates of Churches, doe diſſemble, and make, as though that excéeding great miſchiefe did not iſſue and procéede, when as God, in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie déede, not as a winker at ſuch a matter, but lyke a Iudge, for an example and warning to all the worlde, hath ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Monaſteryes, and houſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making them euen with the ground.)

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1748:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>Whereof it comes, that the feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fayneth a ſacrifice, and that ſuch as be dead, may be purged by the puniſhment of fire: which fyre, although not being perpetuall, yet (as they ſay) terrible: and that the ſayde ſacrifice, coulde deliuer them from the place of tormentes, and raiſe them vp to the felowſhip of Sainctes. Diuerſly alſo, is the minde of many, toſſed to and fre, and drawne hither &amp; thither, into doubtfull cogitations, bycauſe they cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing, for a certaine iudgement, concerning the great controuerſies of our fayth, ſprong vp in this our age: which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alſo a number of mindes, in ſuch ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and boubt, that whyther they ſhall flye for ſuccor, whoſe ayde they ſhall cleaue vnto, and finally, what is the beſt way to be done, they are vtterly ignoraunt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye alſo, are turned from the Goſpell, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye bycauſe of the multitude of heriſies, which for our ſinnes, are brought in, and procured by falſe ſpirites: and partlye by reaſon of the vyces, which by mans owne intemperaunce and diſſolute lyfe, are crept in: Such men being ſeduced from the right
<pb facs="tcp:1748:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſenſe, know not howe to diſcerne betwixt the worke of God, and the worke of the Deuill: nor with a diſcréete perſeuerance, to ſée the difference, how to chooſe, and ſeuer the one from the other. Alſo, there are founde many, who, being diſquieted wyth the often chaunge of Religion, become (in a maner) voyde of beliefe, that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny God at all: and as though he would not well defende their cauſe, they yelde to all vngodlineſſe, &amp; ſcarceſly (naye nor ſo much as ſcarceſly) abſtaine themſelues from blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous wordes. Yea and the weaker ſorte, whoſe iudgement is right, are ſo greatly appalled, when violent perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is imminent, that they quickly departe from Chriſt, and ſtande more a fearde, of them which kill the body, than of him which hath power, to iudge both the bodie &amp; ſoule to hell fire. But, of all the anguiſhes that do vere the ſoule, and diſturbe the minde from the right waye, there can be none more greater, than the anguiſh of conſcience, and the gréeuous remembrance of ſinnes.<note place="margin">The worme of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> For there gnaweth the worme: there the fire burneth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vttermoſt: there hell fire hath

Often we may chaunge our reſting place, take longe pilgrimages in hande, paſſe ouer deſert ſeas, trauell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye countries, both on foote, and by horſe: conueyed maye we be, and paſſe into the furtheſt partes of the worlde: But our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to lay away, our ſelues to forſake, the recorde of our conſcience to forget, and the ſorowfull thinking of our wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, to abandon and caſt from vs, we are not able. For the trouble of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, pricketh vs at home, moueth vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abrode, accompanieth vs in the night, iornyeth with vs, dwelles in the countrye with vs, and whereſoeuer we ſet our foote, or to what place we go, makes hir ſelf ſuch a mate and companion, as will not be ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from vs. The fables do deſcribe, how <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> was tormented and vexed, with burning Torches of the furies in hell. But the lyfe of man throughout, is full of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, how euery mans owne deceyt, guile, naughtineſſe, miſchiefe, preſumption of his

Theſe are the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and inwarde furies, flames, and fyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands to the vngracious, and rebrobate, which day and night, craue puniſhment for them. There is recited by <hi>Plutarke,</hi> a ſtorie worthie of remembraunce, of one <hi>Beſſus,</hi> who killed his father, and for a long ſpace after,<note place="margin">What a murder Beſſus committed.</note> hid and kept cloſe himſelfe: ſo as the cryme being couertlye committed, and no perſon priuie thereto, he coulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue bene ſuſpected and bewrayed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had firſt accuſed himſelfe. But as this murtherer, at a certaine time, went to ſuppe among ſtraungers, he ryfelde downe with his ſpeare, a neſt of Swallowes, and throwing out the yong birdes, trode, and paſhte them vnder his féete. When the companye that ſtoode by, (being, as reaſon was, ſtirred to indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſée this thing) demaunded what ſhoulde be the cauſe, that might mooue him to doe ſo cruell an acte,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1748:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>and to deſtroye the birdes, ſo famillier, and louing vnto man, he aunſwered: haue they not this good while (ſaith he) borne falſe witneſſe againſt me, and with their cryes, accuſed me of my fathers death?

Horrible feare (as <hi>Salomon</hi> moſt truly iudged) doth naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and wicked life bring with it, &amp; makes the conſcience to be as great a teſtimonie, as if a thouſande witneſſes were preſent, and the ſame being conuicted, doth alwaies prognoſticate and looke, for miſchiefe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.

               <hi>Nero,</hi> after he had killed his mother (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> reporteth) coulde neuer endure the grudge of his conſcience, for that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked crime, neyther immediatly vppon the déede done, nor at any time after: although hée were incoraged with conſolations, both of the ſouldiours, Senate, and people of Roome.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1748:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>Truely an euill conſcience in the mynde, is lyke a ſore in the body. It is contriued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row default, not conuayde in by caſualtie.

After that Alexander, that noble king, and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſpoyler of the world, had cruelly ſlaine <hi>Caliſtenes,</hi> and cauſed <hi>Clytus,</hi>

To this number, I maye referre <hi>Herod,</hi>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1748:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>propiciation for the ſinnes of the worlde. Our iuſtification. The Shepehearde and Curate of our ſoules, our hope, our life, and our reſurrection. That he is that Emanuel, the father of eternall life, the Prince of peace, the ſonne of righteouſneſſe, the light of the Gentiles. And to conclude: that he is the very Meſſias, in whom be all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, euen <hi>yeas</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> whom the Leuiticall ſacrifice and olde ceremonies did repreſent. To him, did <hi>Moyſes</hi> lawe tende. Of him, did the Prophetes before prophecie. And, euen the verie ſame, did the fathers of the people of Iſraell wayte for: whom the Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, and all the holy men, in their dayes, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, being ſhewed and ſent among them. Chriſt therefore, the reconciler of God and man, who deliuered vs from the curſſe of the lawe, became a curſſe for our ſakes: and (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth to the <hi>Colloſsians</hi>) hath put out, to them that beleue, the hand writing which was againſt vs: and the ſame being taken out of the way, hath faſtned vpon the Croſſe. He, for a ſwéete incenſe, hath offred vp himſelfe, an oblation, and ſacrifice vnto
<pb facs="tcp:1748:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>God, and by death, hath vndone him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that had the rule of death. He, pacified the fathers wrath, not in part, but wholye and perfitely, and hath fully deliuered vs from the bonde of ſinne, and taken vs out of the pitte of hell. He, (hauing conquered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than) hath borne in token of victorie, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyled power and principalitie, openly in the ſight of the worlde. And ſumptuouſly, and gloriouſly, hath this mightie conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of death and hell, triumphed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ouer thoſe, whom he hath conquered. He hath made plaine the waye to heauen, and aſcending vp on high, hath led captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie captiue, and giuen giftes to men. He ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in heauen, on the right hande of God the father, maketh continuall interceſſion for vs, and beareth the office of a bountifull patrone, aduocate, and ſpokeſman. He day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renueth in vs, the Image and ſimilitude of God: (which is, innocencie, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and holineſſe,) which were loſt in our firſt parent Adam. He (among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, which were adopted by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye father, to bée the children of God) hath made vs copartners with him, both
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1748:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his name, and of his kingdome, and to be heyres of euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe. He it is, that is the true tranquillitie of the minde, and quieting of our conſciences. Hée is the ſtedfaſt peace of the hearte, and pacient mittigation of our troubles. This was the ſame, which was ſhewed and reuealed, in a certaine viſion to <hi>Elyas, the Charret of Iſraell, and the horſemen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi> (as <hi>Elizeus</hi> wordes be) at what time hée fledde to mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> for feare of <hi>Iezabel.</hi> For the word of the Lorde ſpake vnto him, that he ſhould come out of the caue (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he reſted all night) and to ſtande before the Lorde in the Mount. And beholde the Lorde paſſed by, and a mightie ſtrong wind that rent the mountaynes, and brake the rockes before the Lorde: but the Lorde was not in the winde. After the wynde, there came an earth quake: but the Lorde was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake, was a fier, neyther yet was the Lorde in the fier. And after the fier, there came a ſoft ſtill voyce: which, when <hi>Helias</hi> hearde, he couered his face with his mantell. Why was it the Lords pleaſure,
<pb facs="tcp:1748:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>to appéere in a ſoft ſtill voyce, but to ſhews plainely, that he woulde giue reſt and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, vnto ſuch are ſadde and afflicted with veration both of ſoule and minde: ſo as, in their whole heart, they ſéeke after God, and flie onely to him for helpe: as did this <hi>Elias,</hi> when he ſat vnder a Iuniper trée in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wilderneſſe, wiſhing for death. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with this voyce, the Lorde in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, doth mercifully call vnto him, ſuch as are become weake through deſperation, as are troubled in conſcience, and loden wyth cares, ſaying: Come vnto me all yée that labour, and are heauie loden, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh you.<note place="margin">Math. <hi>11.</hi>

We were al by nature, the ſonnes of wrath, and as loſt ſhéepe haue gone aſtray, euery one declyning for the right trade of life, vnto
<pb facs="tcp:1748:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>his own wicked wayes, and forſaking God the fountaine of life, and of all good things, haue purchaſed to our ſelues, miſery, death, and damnation. But Chriſt, of his infinite mercy, left the ſeate of his maieſtie in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and being ſent from aboue, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde, and méekelye, of the virgin Marie, tooke vpon him the nature of man, to the intent he might haue pitie vpon our miſerable ſtate: to ſaue ſinners: to call that backe againe, which was gone aſtray: to ſéeke and ſaue, that which was loſt: and to giue his life for the redemption of manye.

He became the wiſedome of God, the righteouſneſſe; ſanctification,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1748:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>and redemption, for vs. He it is, that bare our ſinnes vpon his backe on the croſſe: that we being dead to ſinne, might liue to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.

And leaſt the ſame ſhould be forgotten of vs, Chriſt, left his bodie in the holy ſacrament, and miſticall banket of his ſupper, which he commaunded to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, directly, with that perſpiquitie of wordes, which he himſelfe ordeyned and appoynted, that it might effectually be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of the olde offered ſacrifice: and playnly, as it were with liuely Image, to repreſent the death of our redemer, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly, and after a ſort, laying it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the communicantes: that all the people, with meditation of ſo great &amp; fearefull a miſterie, being godly amazed, and as it were rauiſhed beyond the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, ſhoulde for that time, occupie themſelues with nothing, nor haue any other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in their mindes, but of Chriſt onely crucified on the Croſſe.

<pb facs="tcp:1748:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>in this ſort miniſtred, according to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes inſtitution, might by meanes of the worthineſſe of the wordes, and vertue of the holye ſpirite, mightilye worke in the minde, and earneſtly ſtirre vp the ſame: and alſo, might plainly before the eyes of all the people, diſcribe Chriſt, paint him out, and (as <hi>Paule</hi> hath to the <hi>Galathians</hi>) in a maner crucifie him a newe. And hereof growes that exceſſe of ſaint <hi>Chriſoſtomes</hi> wordes: Imagine (ſayth he) the bloud of ſaluation flowing as it were out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and vnpolluted ſide: and that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and wonderfull bloud, running into the Cup, to purifie vs: and there, the tongue taſting, to be made red and blouddie: and ſo drawe nighe, and receyue it with pure lips.</p>

For he not content onely to redéeme vs, and after that redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to put vs in dayly remembrance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but he verily alſo, and in déede, féedeth and nouriſheth the faythfull, with his owne liuely fleſhe, ſo long as they ſhall liue here like ſtraungers, &amp; aliants, and till they haue made an ende of this habitation. He increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thereby our fayth, ſtrengthneth vs to abide tribulation, confirmes our hope of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing eternal life, kindleth our loue towards him, mainteynes our brotherly charitie, prolonges our lyfe, and frames the ſame to good order, quieteth our conſciences, and (as thoughe he forgatte our ſinnes) reconciles himſelfe againe vnto vs. He bréedeth in our mindes, thereby, ſpirituall pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, draweth awaye our ymaginations from the frailtie of our bodies, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs to thinke of immortalitie, and that,
<pb facs="tcp:1748:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>which is moſt of all, he cooples and ioynes vs to himſelfe, mixeth vs, and (as I maye ſay) vnites and incorporates vs with him, in a moſt ſure bonde. Which contriuing and linking one within an other, the ſenſible nature of man can not comprehende: Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, howe he is our heade, and we his members, and fleſhe of his fleſhe, bone of his bones: nor howe he dwelleth and liueth in vs, and we in him. For if it be a thing to be maruelled at, howe we be members one of another, and man and wife maye be all one fleſhe: howe much more wonderfull, is this moſt nighe coopling togither of Chriſt, and vs: which doth moſt truly, and certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not faynedly, colourably, or phantaſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, happen vnto ſuch, as doe faythfully eate this ſacrament. Whereat, the diuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete, being helde with admiration, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied ſaying:<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>110.</hi>
               </note> The mercifull and gracious Lorde, hath ſo done his maruellous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that they ought to be had in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting remembraunce, he hath giuen meate to them that feare him. Wherefore, to this poynt,<note place="margin">The apt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Cyrillus.</note> doth the ſimilitude of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> aptly concurre. Euen as (ſayth he) if one take

            <p>But now, that we haue béene occupied, in calling to minde, the benifites which are annexed to the Lordes ſupper, being dulye miniſtred, as it ought to be, and worthylye receyued of the faithfull: let vs returne to the matter, which we haue in hande, (that is to ſay) to the great miſterie of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and redemption: through remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce whereof, there groweth peace of conſcience, and tranquillitie of mynde. Whereby, though the Deuill putte vs in feare, the worlde diſquiet vs, and the fleſhe prouoke vs, yet the ſame remayneth ſtill in perpetuall quietneſſe, &amp; ſecuritie. Thence commeth it, that the multitude of ſinnes, and greatneſſe of them, doe not debarre vs the way to Gods mercie: nor the abyding in ſinne for a ſeaſon, vtterly take away all hope of forgiueneſſe. From thence ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our loue that we haue towardes God,
<pb facs="tcp:1748:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>which ſpared not his owne Sonne: but for all our ſakes gaue him to death, and with him gaue vs all good things. Thence riſeth that déepe mindefulneſſe of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifites, in that he adopted vs to be his owne children: and for this benifite, continuall thankes is to be celebrated of all the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. There is nothing in all the worlde, that at ſuch time, as we are meditating vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Chriſt, can once pierſe our conſcience: much leſſe driue it to deſperation: were it for committing the greateſt ſinne of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if tranſgreſſing of the law, brings terror vnto vs: It helpeth againe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that Chriſt hath redemed vs from the curſe of the law. If ſinne trouble vs: we are recomforted, in that Chriſt, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the debtor ten thouſand tallents, which ought a great deale: forgaue Peter, that had grieuouſly offended him: pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Théefe, who had long continued in ſinne: but alſo, by his owne bloud, waſhed vs cleane from all ſinne. If death gréeue vs: Chriſt is become both our lyfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. If the wrath of God make vs penſiue: by Chriſt are we reconciled vnto
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1748:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>God. If hell fire feare vs: Chriſt by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of Hell, hath opened the gates of heauen.<note place="margin">Purgatory</note> If the fire of Purgatorie diſquiet our mindes: Chriſt for the ſinnes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, hath ſatiſfied God: and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by Gods iuſtice, was done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, he himſelfe hath abydden it, and hath not onely deliuered vs from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence it ſelfe, but alſo, from the paine due for the ſame. For otherwiſe, how ſhoulde either they, which be iuſtified by their faith, be at peace with God, (when as peace may in no wiſe be conuerſaunt with feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment) if they ſhoulde be in perplexitie, for feare of greater puniſhment. Eyther elſe, how ſhoulde the Saintes, receyue here the full forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, if they ſhould be recompenſt with paine, due for ſinne, in an other worlde, being departed out of this life. Wherefore, the holy fathers (and that conſonaunt to the ſcriptures) were of the opinion, that all remiſſion of ſinnes, is here in this life: yea, and ſo fullye, as no parte thereof,<note place="margin">Cyprian in his treatiſe againſt De metrianus.</note> is differred till any other life to come. For ſo writeth bleſſed <hi>Cyprian:</hi> Here is (ſaith he) the ſoule eyther loſt or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<pb facs="tcp:1748:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>Here doe we prouide for eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, for the worſhipping of God, and for the fruite of faith. Neyther let any mans ſinnes or yeares, be a hinderaunce to hym, from the attaynement of ſaluation. To him, that hath as yet any being in this lyfe, there is no repentaunce to late. To mercy the waye is open, and frée acceſſe is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, for ſuch as ſeeke and vnderſtande the truth. But when we are departed from hence, then is there no place of repentance, nor any ſatiſfaction to be made. And of the ſame opinion was <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Ambroſe</note> and other godly writers, which were exerciſed in the holy ſcriptures, &amp; did ſet forth treatyes and interpretations vpon the ſame. The Lorde increaſe the faith of many, and giue them a better minde, that they may truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue in the ſonne of God, and earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, from the bottome of their heart: who in their wordes profeſſe chriſtian religion, but neuertheleſſe, in their déedes, kicke, and ſpurne againſt the Goſpell, and denye the ſame, ſet ſorth to ſo godly a purpoſe. Who count the bloudde of the Teſtament, but a prohpane thing, and reprochfully vſe the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1748:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſpirite of grace. Who although they doe not openly ſcorne this holy miſterie, which we haue ſo much intreated of, yet they doe not reuerently imbrace the ſame, and with ſuch feare and dreade as they ought to doe. In the dayes of Paule, Chriſt was to the Iewes, an occaſion of fall: but to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, a méere fooliſhneſſe. In our dayes, Chriſt is no leſſe wonderfully ſpronge vp againe, than in olde time, he was borne and bredde at <hi>Beathlem</hi> in <hi>Iurie:</hi> Nor no leſſe reuiued, nilling the aduerſaries, then, when he roſe vp agayne man earthquake, the Sepulker being cloſe ſhutte. I am a fearde, leaſt Sathan, the fleſhe, and the worlde, doe driue a number, to be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, as Chriſt becommeth vnſauerie to them, &amp; that they cannot taſte howe ſwéete the lord is, and how plentifully the ſtreame of the Riuer, makes glad the citye of God. A ſenſible perſon, cannot ſo muche as dreame, what the ioye of the Children of God is: and how daye and night, without intermiſſion, they ſing, lifting vp their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and gyuing thankes vnto the Lorde their God. Rightly doe we attribute vnto
<pb facs="tcp:1748:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt, that he will eaſe and refreſhe our ſoules: and will not onely diſcharge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, and ſet at libertie, them which bée captiuated with the tirannie of Sathan, but alſo wil leade the very ſame captiuitie cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: Although our troubled conſciences, many times, are more greeuouſly daſhed with terror of the law, then they be appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with comfort of the Goſpell of peace. Of verye right alſo, doe we impute it to his bountifulneſſe, that he is the remedie of our woundes, the reſt of our afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and the true tranquillitie of our minde.</p>
            <p>This we knowe by the worde of God,<note place="margin">Comfort ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the worde of God.</note> which is the light of our eyes, and the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne to our féete: wherein as we liue, ſo ought we continually to be occupied therin, both day and night, for the finding out of ſuch thinges, as maye further vs to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement of bleſſedneſſe, to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our life, to the comfort of our ſoule, and the abandoning of cares from vs. Howe often in the holy ſcriptures, are they pronounced bleſſed, which be diligent hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and readers of this worde, if vpon the

They by their Art, onely adde a certaine faſhion to things: but to chaunge the verie matter whereon they worke, as of ſiluer to make golde, they are not able.

And if we perſiſt in holineſſe, therein we become more firme and ſtedfaſt through them: and by laying holde vpon the Goſpell, we ſettle our minde, leading it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from worldly buſineſſe, and thereby, diligently clenſe our life being voide of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. The Philoſophers, Rhetricians, and Ethnicke wryters, deſiring to be had in admiration, did but ſhadow in a certaine darke ſenſe, the ſecrete thinges of their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But the Apoſtles and Prophetes, as vniuerſall teachers of the worlde, haue put things in wryting, ſo plainly and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, as by reading onely, they may be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Who, hearing, that happie are the méeke, the mercifull, and ſo forth with the reſt, will deſire any ſcholemayſter to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete the ſame? But if in thinges which be more ſecrete, thou ſhalt not perhappes find an inſtructor, and wilt beſtow the more earneſt ſtudie therein: God, ſéeing thy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and not deſpiſing thy care and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1748:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>no doubt will open the thing to thée which thou ſéekeſt for. Remember the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuke, in the .viij. of the Actes, who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, obtayned a guide. God, which knewe the readie inclination of his minde, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his indeuour, and ſent him (by and by) an expounder. A great defence agaynſt ſin, is the reading of the ſcriptures: but a great daungerous ruyne, and a déepe dungeon of blindneſſe, is want of knowledge of the ſcriptures: and to knowe nothing of Gods lawe, is a great lacke of ſaluation. For that is it, which hath bredde hereſies, brought in filthie life, and turned all vpſydowne. For it cannot be, that often and héedefull reading, ſhould bring no fruit with it. This excellent exhortation of S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> (who for his godly eloquence, obtayned the ſurname of golden mouthed) did bleſſed <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> imitate and follow: who, aptly, conueniently, plainly, and excellently well, doe ſet forth with due prayſe, the moſt heauenly worde of the Scriptures. That minde (ſaye they) is an enimie to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of ours, which either in going aſtray, knoweth not the ſame to be wholſome, or
<pb facs="tcp:1748:53"/>elſe being ſicke, doth lothe medicine. For the verie phraſe of ſpeach which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vſeth,<note place="margin">Gregorie in an Epiſtle to biſhop Lean.</note> hath the way to nurſe hir little ones abroade, and to preſerue them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and alſo how to occupie their mindes, with admiration of high miſteries.

It ſettes not forth it ſelfe wyth haughtie communication, and therevnto the ſlacke and vnlearned minde (as poore to the riche) dare not approche. But it inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all men, with an humble ſpeach. Not onely It féedeth them, with apparaunt and knowne truth, but alſo It exerciſeth them in ſecrete veritie, ſetting that abroad to the worlde, which it hath in ſecrete ſtore. But leaſt thoſe things, which be plaine, ſhould be contemned, thoſe ſecrete things againe are deſired: being deſired, are after a ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and being renued, are ſwéetely ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied what they be.

For the worde of God knoweth fayth, when it firſt groweth, when it comes to rype yeares, when it is brought to full perfection: and when it draweth to olde age againe, it nouriſheth the ſame with gentle and wholſome foode.

We muſt ſubmit our necke vnder the yoke of Chriſt, that we may ſhewe our ſelues as Diſciples in following our mayſter: who like a true Shepherd hath pledged his life for his flock, and hath yelded himſelfe, to the moſt vile &amp; contemptuous death of the croſſe.

By which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, we may acknowledge the true voyce, of the true ſhepehearde, more than eyther the Oxe that knoweth his Lorde, or the Aſſe, his maiſters ſtable. Rightly therefore, the auncient holye Fathers, preferred this vertue in Chriſtian pietie, aboue others. Well and eligantly did Saint <hi>Barnard,</hi> ſet it before virginitie,<note place="margin">An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the virginitie, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> in this maner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon: Virginitie (ſayth he) is a comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable vertue, but more neceſſarie is humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. The one is councelled to be kept: the other is commaunded to be had. To the one
<pb facs="tcp:1748:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>thou art called: to the other thou art forced. Of the firſt it is ſayde, he that can compaſſe it let him doe: of the latter it is ſpoken, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man become as one of theſe little ones, he ſhall not enter into the kingdome of heauen. The one therfore is recompenſt: the other is demaunded at our hands. Thou mayſt without virginitie be ſaued: wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humilitie, thou canſt not. Where la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is made for virginitie loſt, there can humilitie pacifie againe. Without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie (I dare take vpon me to ſay) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the virginitie of Mary, had not béene ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Vpon whome (ſayth the worde) ſhall my ſpirite reſt? vpon the humble and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (he ſayth) not vpon the virgin, ſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Marie hir owne ſelfe: He regarded the lowlineſſe of his handmayden.

Howe appeares that? eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bicauſe hir humility doubtleſſe brought to paſſe that hir virginitie was ſo lyked of. Virginitie (truely) is not with euery one: but with farre fewer is humilitie ioyned with virginitie. If thou canſt not but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the virginitie in Marie, endeuour to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1748:63"/>follow hir humilitie, and it is ſufficient for thée. But if thou be a virgin, and haue alſo the grace of humilitie, thou art great, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou be. Hitherto <hi>Barnard.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, to come by the pure knowledge of the Scriptures, we muſt bende our ſelues very much to charitie: vnto the which,<note place="margin">How nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the ſcripture.</note> we ought to haue a ſpeciall regarde. For elſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge maketh men haughtie, when on the contrarie part, charitie edifieth. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle willeth vs, that we ſéeke to excell vnto edifying. For if we haue all knowledge, and haue no charitie, we are nothing. Adde moreouer to the knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that we muſt forſake the world, with hir pompes and flatteries. We muſt reſiſt Sathan, with his craftes and fierie dartes. We muſt not incline our ſelues to ſurfey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, dronkenneſſe, and the pleaſures of this life: but repugne the mocions of the fleſhe. We muſt be diligent in our vocation, vſe abſtinence, and liue blameleſſe in our lyfe. And from thence procéedes the promiſe: that who ſo doth his will, the ſame ſhal perceiue by the doctrine, whoſe it is. And againe: Bleſſed be the cleane in heart, for they ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:1748:64"/>ſée God. And laſtly, to the knowledge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: In ſo holye a worke, we muſt auoyde diſputations, which be vngodly, and done out of due tyme.

Wherefore, rightlye did one vtter that noble ſentence: boldelye and without feare he declared it: that <hi>the bloud of Martires is the ſeede of Chriſtes religion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A noble ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> But now that wée haue largely inough ſet forth, how, and in what maner, euery man ought to behaue hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to finde out the truth, in the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome time of controuerſie, concerning our fayth, and haue intreated of euerie thing in order, as matters neceſſarie for our purpoſe did fall out.

To be ſhort: all ſuch as are excluded there from, as wittingly and wyllingly, repugnaunt to the Table of the ten commaundements, with all proneneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:1748:75"/>of minde, ruſhe hedlong into all miſchiefe &amp; naughtineſſe. A great way alſo are they ſeuered from thys peace (to recken euery ſinne more perticularly) which be whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, adoulterers, delicate perſons, théeues, couetous folke, drunkardes, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, extorcyoners, vniuſt and wicked men, mankyllers, lyers, periurers, enuyers, whiſperers, backbyters, ſpightfull, highe minded, and glorious men, and al vncleane perſons, which obſtinatelye contynue in their ſinnes, and boldly followe whatſoeuer is enimy vnto the wholſome doctrine of the Euangeliſt, and vnto the glory of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God.

And all thoſe which be prophaners of his temple, and runne hedlong into vice, the Lorde will deſtroy and iudge, except they repent: For he will puniſhe them with a ſeconde death, caſting them into the lake, burning
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1748:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>with fyre and brimſtone, and condemning them to euerlaſting paine. For they obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not the ſpirite of promiſe eyther by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their vnbeliefe, pride, and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, eyther for that they were apparelled with no workes of righteouſneſſe, nor prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed the worde of God, as they ought to haue done: but lyued after their owne wayes, or rather after the maner of Dogs, in gyuing themſelues to vncleaneſſe, ryot, and other vices. And bicauſe they walked on ſtill, after the maner of men, in their owne concupiſcenſes, not agréeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, therefore hath the Lorde, whyle they yet liue, called them deade: the Apoſtle, named them fleſhely and beaſtlye: the Prophete, termed them cattell and brute beaſts: common experience, counted them no better than cattell voyde of reaſon: and finally, the lawe it ſelfe hath iudged them vncleane perſons.</p>
            <p>Therefore, they only are taught by Chriſt,<note place="margin">To whome Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the true tranquillitie of the minde.</note> and finde reſt vnto their ſoules, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinne, and turne to their God by fayth, eſpeciallye with the deſire of their heart: which crucifie the fleſh with hir luſtes, and

They only aſcend to that bleſſed kingdome, wherein is ioy and peace in the holy ghoſt, which perceiue the loue of God towardes them, and imbrace the ſame from the bottome of their heart, with than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſgiuing, helping their poore brethren, as farre as their habilitie wil ſtretch, both with their trauell, councell, and ſubſtance.

<pb facs="tcp:1748:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>and put away the prowde prouocations vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to luſtes, both with remedies appoynted for that purpoſe, and alſo by ſuch other helpes as are worthie of commendation in that matter. For there be vnlawfull remedies, ſuch as deſtroy nature, haſten our end, and in ſhort ſpace bring plague and deſtruction to the bodie. And they are guiltie of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and effuſion of bloud, which exerciſe ſuch (I ſay not remedyes) but poyſonings of nature.

Wherefore, let him firſt with earneſt inclination towards the word of God, fight againſt the raging of the fleſh, by fayth and prayer: and through thys wholſome and excellent remedie, in all that he can, to quench and abate the courage of the ſame. For he that loueth often and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent reading of the Scriptures, wherein the Godly may heare, how God threatneth his wrath to whoremongers, adulterers, and to ſuche as are polluted with the like vice: where, on the contrarie part, with libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall promiſes, he gently calles them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, comfortes the ſorowfull, relieues
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1748:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>the afflicted, confirmes the wauering, calles men backe from deſperation: ſuch a one hath prepared a ſtrong holde, to ſuppreſſe the wickedneſſe of the fleſhe. Likewiſe, they fortifie themſelues with an excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who be at hearing of Sermons, which the Preachers of wholſome doctrine doe make: and heare with willing eares, the wordes of the Goſpell, at the handes of the faythfull diſpoſer of Gods miſteryes, and of the true Miniſter of the Church: and doe coutch the ſame within their heart and mind, and in the ſame wholy, willingly, and with all their heart repoſe themſelues, no leſſe, than if it were the voyce of Chriſt, here preſent, or as if it were ſpoken from out of heauen. The verie ſame alſo is wrought, through priuate talke of godly men among themſelues, while the worde of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the remedies agaynſt vice, is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully frequented amongſt them with all wiſedome, and while they inſtruct and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhe one an other: whoſe companie if we fanſie, and with them conferre, méete, and familierly vſe, they will excellently wel inſtruct vs, to withſtande ſinne with ghoſtly

But aboue all, we muſt without delay, and with all confidence, flie to the ayd and helpe of our heauenly father, who hath both commaunded vs to praye, and taught vs the forme of prayer: And further, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs by neceſſitie to call vnto him, hath made vs to attend for his helpe, hath incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged vs by his promiſe, and alſo heareth vs at ſuch time as his pleaſure ſhall be, and that in better ſort than we our ſelues can deſire. A worthie ſaying therefore, is that, of the holy man <hi>Bernard.</hi> Brethren (ſayth he) I woulde not haue you doubt of your prayer, but knowe ye, that euen when the worde iſſueth out of your mouth, then is your prayer wrytten in the ſight of God: and it ſhall bée eyther graunted you, whiche is deſyred, or elſe it is not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to haue it graunted. Wherefore, we muſt call vpon GOD feruently, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlye open our Prayer vnto him, when wée be touched wyth the taſte of oure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles. For looke euen howe much more greater the daunger and neceſſitie is, ſo much the prompter and readier ought our minde be to pray. For the prayers are but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1748:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>faynt, of thoſe which liue in great ſecurity, and are troubled with no priuate diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. Neyther were it requiſite by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our vnworthyneſſe, that we decyſted from praying. But it behoues vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member rather, that God doth retoyce at the name, which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo oft doth attry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto him: which is, that we truely acknowledge him to be the hearer of our prayers. But and if he ſhall not in euerye poynt, conſent to our demaund, yet whilſt we ſtill continue all night in prayer, and be not wearie thereof, he will ſhewe vs the waye wherevnto he hath called vs: which we muſt enter into, if we proſper not, nor preuaile in the firſt, and maye lawfully proue the ſame, without offending him, if God ſhall draw vs thereto, by denying our requeſt. Moreouer,<note place="margin">Howe to ſuppreſſe concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.</note> to the furtheraunce thereof, we muſt auoyde ſuch as be peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of good ſtudyes, all thintiſementes to pleaſures, flattering, fawnings, vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt games, laſhing expences, banquets out of due time, immoderate and conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall drinking, vndecent ſhewes, ſongs of loue, wanton daunces, naughtie company,
<pb facs="tcp:1748:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>but eſpeciallye, we muſt ſhunne ydleneſſe, which is cauſe, both of theſe euilles, and of a number mo. For ydleneſſe is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable to the fleſh: which delighteth aboue meaſure in ſloth, lytherneſſe, ceaſſing from occupation, ſluggiſhneſſe, and heauyneſſe of minde: and it hath a deſire to be doing of nothing, and to be voyde of all care and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.

Wherefore it is neceſſary that with Godly ſtudies, and honeſt occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we continuallye reſiſt the pride of the fleſhe, and with accuſtomed faſting and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1748:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>hunger, (but the ſame moderate) we bridle the violence therof: and alſo that with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſobriety and temperaunce, we kéepe vnder our laciuious lyfe. Whatſoeuer the deuill ſhall ſugieſt, and will vs to doe, the ſame muſt we diligently traueyle to ſhake of, euen with all the expedition we can: and we muſt neyther wyllingly conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, nor yet reſt any longer vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, but ſtraite waye ſlie to the aſſiſtaunce of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and poure out our prayers before him, expelling from our minde (as it were one nayle wyth another) euill thoughts, with other thoughts which are better. And let vs remember the ſayings and examples of the miſticall ſcriptures, which forbid all filthyneſſe, and pronownce wrath and puniſhment, againſt thoſe which be defiled. Let vs be abaſhte to commit in the ſight of God, (who ſéeth all things) ſuch filthineſſe as we would be aſhamed off, if, but our owne companion ſhould be priuie therevnto. Let it come into our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, what we profeſſed in baptiſme, howe famous conquerours, warryours, and Captaines we would become: and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Let vs ſtill beare in minde, the ſhortneſſe and vncertainetie of this lyfe, death in a maner euerye minute to be looked for. Let vs thinke of the laſt and dreadfull iudgement, of hell, the féends and fire that ſhall neuer be extinguiſhed. Through remembraunce whereof, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull raging of our fleſhe and luſtes of the ſame, maye be abated, and for feare of puniſhment of our wickedneſſe, we will kéepe our ſelues in better order. But and if we preuaile nothing, through all theſe remedies: if we perceiue our ſelues to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite little, neyther by the earneſt practiſing of the worde of God, neyther by the conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall company of good and godlye men, by often prayers made to God, nor yet by ſhunning of ydleneſſe, and auoyding the diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, which enſue vpon the ſame: If neyther by earneſt induſtrie, and ſtudie, by honeſt labors, godly exerciſes and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations: if through much hunger, faſting

Let vs therefore thinke, and vtterly reſolue in our hart and minde, the thing which is moſt true, (that is to ſay) that a naughtie and corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, can not call vpon God: which is playne, by that ſaying of Iohn, in his firſt Epiſtle and thirde Chapter. If our heart condemne vs not, then haue we truſt to God warde: and whatſoeuer we aſke, we ſhall receyue of him. It is a lamentable thing, in ſuch ſorte to liue, as thou dareſt neyther call vpon God, nor yet to put thy truſt in his gouernment and defence. Such perſons ſo lyuing without God, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyenated from a godly lyfe, the deuill doth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1748:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>blinde euery day more and more, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraps them in hainous crimes. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teſtifieth in playne words,<note place="margin">Ephe. <hi>4.</hi>

            <p>He ſendeth aduerſitie vpon them,<note place="margin">The firſt cauſe.</note> to the ende, that they féeling the greatneſſe of gods wrath agaynſt ſinne, maye altogither ſée, how baſe they be of themſelues: acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging alſo the guile of their owne ſpirite, may perceyue howe farre they be from dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelues, and from liuing onely to the glorie of God. Very often doth ſubtile ſecuritie, ydle féebleneſſe, craftie hypocriſie, flattering loue of a mans ſelfe, ſecret pride, and cloſe contemning of God, créepe into heartes of the Saintes: all which through
<pb facs="tcp:1748:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>affliction, as with fire, muſt be burned and boyled out. For God is a iealous God, and deſires to be loued in déede, and to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with all the hart. He loueth nothing that is fayned, nothing that is counterfeyt: but all things,<note place="margin">Why God ſheweth himſelf an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his elect.</note> which be ſincere, vnfayned and liuely. For this cauſe he doth ſhewe himſelfe angrie with his elect, and bringes troubles vpon them, that they being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite in hart, may beginne to miſlike them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to ſhake off their olde ſlouth, fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, ſecuritie and diſſimulation: and ſo remembring their infirmitie, maye from thenceforth be earneſtly bent, to praye to God, and more ſolicitus to liue a godly life. For as ſalt preſerueth fleſhe, that it doe not putrifie, and the drawing playſter, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and purgeth that part of the bodie, which is ſore, leaſt through corrupt matter it pine away: and as the hote yron, béeing put therevnto, burneth out and conſumeth, whatſoeuer ſhoulde hinder the recouerie thereof: ſo doth tribulation (leaſt we ſhould waxe rotten in the filthyneſſe of ſinne) drawe vs backe from the renuing of ſinne, taketh away the delight of reſting in euill,

            <p>Moreouer, through miſerie,<note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe.</note> God calles away his elect from the loue of this worlde, wherein they haue proufe and experience, onely of troubles and diſquietneſſe: who béeing drawne away before, by the flicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring intiſementes of creatures, he now lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des them back againe, to the loue and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of him their Creator.

For euen as, by long boyling of golde, which is throwne into the Fornace, any other corrupt thing mixed therewith, is tryed out, and taken away from it: lyke ſo, through trouble and aduerſitie, both the delight we haue in creatures, the flattering we make of our ſelues, the confidence we haue in men, and whatſoeuer elſe is not pure, vaniſheth away and is put from vs: and the minde thereby wholy bent vppon
<pb facs="tcp:1748:95"/>God, of whome it wayteth to obtaine a quietneſſe. Wherefore, it is not without a cauſe that iudgement beginneth firſt at the houſe of the Lord: when as the harts of the Saintes, being by this meanes made ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt, lyke waxe, are become of righter iudgement and of better minde. Which thinge, in times paſt was ſignified, by that, when as God ſo would, that all the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers vpon the children of Iſraell, ſhould be enimies vnto them.</p>
            <p>And as well theſe priuate miſeryes and infelicities,<note place="margin">The thirde cauſe.</note> as alſo publike calamities, be, after a ſort,<note place="margin">Publike calamuies the voyce of the lawe.</note> the voyce of the lawe, and more ſharper Leſſons, than any Sermons, that the Miniſters can make in the temple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning repentaunce.

<pb facs="tcp:1748:114"/>which be vnlearned, vngodlye, baine tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, drunkardes, raſhe bablers abroade, whatſoeuer we tell them in ſecret, affected with no priuate féele of ſinne, no Prieſtes, but counterfeyters of Prieſtes, no nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, but bondſlaues of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and raſcall of the common wealth: of whome we cannot looke for remedie of our ſinnes, nor to be inſtructed in godlines: (For how can they by their doctrine make vs better, when by their examples they may make vs worſe) refuſing ſuch, I ſay, let vs, if ſo occaſion fall out, go to the lay man which is indued with the ſame giftes that are in a godly Miniſter, and with him let vs conferre: to him let vs open our griefes and troubles: if he can giue vs anye good councell, let vs heare and receyue it with a willing minde. Let vs often beare in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce the miſtery of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, accompliſhed and performed in Chriſt: and whereſoeuer the holye Supper of the Lorde is rightly diſtributed and ordered as it ought to be, thyther let vs often aſſemble, to receyue the ſame worthilye togither. Whereby we ſhall ſtrengthen our mindes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1748:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the ſure hope of our ſaluation, we ſhal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take fruit of the heauenly pleaſure, while we yet liue here: and when we be called by God to depart this life, we ſhal be in a good readineſſe, and well ſetled in an excellent hope of dying well. But if ſo be we caſt all ſhamefaſtneſſe from vs, making our ſelues common to falſe Gods, to commit adultrie with them like ſhameleſſe Harlots, and ſo wickedly depart from God, leauing him, ſo louing a huſband, to runne like a light huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife a whoring to Idols: it is greatly to be feared, leaſt he make vs a Bill of deuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then we vtterly looſe his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace and fauour, and through our owne default, be depriued of the heritage of that bleſſed kingdome, and ſo put for euer from that moſt delectable beholding of god, from the felowſhip of Aungels, and ſocietie of Saintes. Let vs not imagine in our ſelues good intentes and meanings, when they haue a ſhewe thereof, and yet be contrary to the worde of God: ſince from thence riſe oftentymes doctrine of Deuils, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticious and vngodly cuſtomes: but wyth great charineſſe, let vs reiect them from vs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1748:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>For by them, the children of Iſraell being beguyled, did ſacryfice their children to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</hi> Thereby, <hi>Aron</hi> erected the Caulfe, to the intent he might kéepe the people in their duetie and obedience. Thereby the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes perſecuted the Apoſtles, ſuppoſing they did God good ſeruice therein. Let vs beare away, what happened to <hi>Vza</hi> for ſtaying the Arke, &amp; to <hi>Saule</hi> for ſauing king <hi>Agag</hi> and the beſt cattell. Let vs not thinke, that we ought to proue our owne wiſedome, or to followe the aduiſe of mans heart, which is prone and inclyned to euill, nor to doe that which ſéemeth good and right in our owne eyes: but let vs doe that, which the Lorde our God hath willed and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to doe: whoſe voyce when we here, let vs not harden our harts, but in hearing the ſame, to declare our true obedience, which the Lorde hath alwaye preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue oblation and ſacrifice. Let vs neuer ſo long as we haue breath and lyfe within vs, conſent to the intiſements of the world, to the ſuggeſtion of Sathan, or to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the fleſhe: nor ſuffer our ſelues, through their iolly flatteries, to be inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1748:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ouercome, as it were wyth the ſwéete tune of the Marmayde: or to reſt (as ſéemeth to the vngracious) in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt ſlumber of ſinne. But let vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, with all our force &amp; might, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to make continuall warre wyth thoſe thrée moſt cruell aduerſaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let vs call to remembrance, that God is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: and by lyuing well, let vs trie whyther we haue the teſtimonie of a good conſcience: and not onely to laye holde of the liuely hope of our ſaluation, but euery day alſo, to increaſe the ſame more &amp; more. Let vs knowledge and confeſſe, that the moſt true worde of God, (which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye comfort of our ſoules,<note place="margin">In the time of Qucene Mary.</note> and wherein conſiſteth the ſpiritual kingdome of Chriſt) is taken away from vs for our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and that we haue deſerued to be put from the ſame: which is ſo ineſtimable a benefite, as Dauid being amazed, when he thought therevpon, ſong this Verſe: The Lorde (ſayth he) hath not done ſo to euery nation, nor his iudgement hath he opened to the heathen people. Wherefore, with iuſt ſorowing let vs lament: and let
<pb facs="tcp:1748:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>vs pray to God contynually, that he wyll forget our ſinnes, and reſtore vs to hys grace and fauour againe. And although, not bicauſe of our vnworthyneſſe, yet for the aduauncement of his name, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging of his honor, he will riſe vp and defende the conſtant defenders of his pure religion, and ouerthrowe the obſtinate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of the truth, which are Authors of darkeneſſe, and ſubuerters of ſoules: that he will by his iuſt iudgement giue them due puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for their deſert. Who knowing him to be God, doe not glorifie hym as GOD, nor obey the Goſpell of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: but wandering in their owne inuentions, and ſticking to their owne wyſedome, rather ſuppreſſe and keepe vnder the worde of GOD. But theſe (except they ſhortly repent) ſhall ſuffer puniſhment, euen death euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, from the face of the Lorde, and from the glorie of his might: when he ſhal come to be glorified in his Saintes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wonderfull vnto all true beléeuers in him. But if affliction fall vppon vs, let vs recken it in ſteade of a benefite vnto vs:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1748:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſince the Lorde thereby, rather informs vs as children, calling vs into the right waye, then reiectes vs as Baſtardes and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, to reſerue a greater puniſhment for vs in Hell. Let vs in tyme of aduerſitie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon all naughtie murmurings againſt our merciful God, and vſe often prayer and thankes giuing vnto him, with a ſure hope and confidence in his mercy: which thing, is the moſt acceptable ſacrifice of all other: If affliction oppreſſe vs, and there be no ſtaye of miſeries and diſquietneſſe, let vs by ſtaying vpon Gods promiſes, caſt our minde beyond all griefe and vexation, vpon the euerlaſting good thinges: and by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one againſt the other, tranſferre thoſe heauie troubles, which preſently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt vs, to the rewarde of immortalitie and euerlaſting ioyes to come. Let vs fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue with our ſelues, that there is neyther fortune nor chaunce, but that all things be moſt righteouſly gouerned by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God almightie: and that, what diſpleaſure and miſerie ſoeuer doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in mans life, happeneth for the beſt to them which haue reſpect to godlyneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:1748:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>and loue God from the bottome of their hart: and hauing a feruent zeale towards him, doe deſire him earneſtlye, doe chooſe him for their Protector and defender in all their affaires, doe call vpon him onely, doe flie to his mercie onely, and doe repoſe their truſt on him as their onely and alone ſuccour. So we putting our truſt in the frée goodneſſe, mercy, and clemencie of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, ſhall be repleniſhed with excellent comfort, and being kindled with loue of the true &amp; eternall good things, ſhal be brought with a full and perfite courſe to that moſt deſired quietneſſe of minde. Where we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the ſpirite, be it in proſperity or aduerſitie, let vs ſpeake vnto our ſelues in Pſalmes, and Hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs, ſinging and making melodie in our hartes, with thanks giuing alwayes to the Lorde for all thinges, in the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, which is one and the ſame both yeſterday and to day, &amp; for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. To God the Father alſo who is king of Kings, and Lorde of Lordes: who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye hath immortalitie, and dwelleth in the light that no man can attaine: who large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1748:117"/>plentifully and aboundantly, will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with his elect people, the thing which here onely in the heartes of Saintes is begonne: euen the reſt of eternall life which we ſo greatly long for: through his beloued ſonne, in whome he hath made vs deare vnto him: To him be domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, vertue, power, glorie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and prayſe euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinglye, worlde without end.
